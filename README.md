<img width="1120" height="500" alt="Life Expectancy by Country 2023" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb330d66-e1ed-4a9e-ad79-e8efbcea9d43" />


## Overview  
This project analyzes global life expectancy data from 1960 to 2024, providing insights into trends across countries, regions, and income groups. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

---

## Project Structure  
- **Data Import**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, containing life expectancy metrics for various countries and demographic groups.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns are removed, and the dataset is transformed from a wide format to a long format for easier analysis.  
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration includes viewing the dataset structure and performing basic data transformations.  
- **Visualization**: The project includes scripts for creating visualizations to explore life expectancy trends over time and across different categories.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Data Transformation**: The dataset is unpivoted to convert years into a single column, making it suitable for time-series analysis.  
- **Geographical Analysis**: Life expectancy data is categorized by country, region, and income group for detailed comparative analysis.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilizes Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for creating interactive and static visualizations.  

---

## Libraries Used  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.  
- **Base64**: For encoding and decoding data.  

---

## How to Use  
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset (`life_exp.csv`) is placed in the specified directory.  
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the Jupyter notebook (`life.ipynb`) to perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.  
3. **Explore Results**: Analyze the visualizations and insights generated from the data.  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Develop dashboards for more dynamic data exploration.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to forecast future life expectancy trends.  
- **Additional Data Sources**: Incorporate supplementary datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
